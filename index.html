      A.I. or Artificial Intelligence is a powerful technology system that has become very popular through Alexa, Siri and Cortana. Us humans have become very reliant on this technology in our day to day live. In the future many scientist agree that A.I. will become one of the most profitable sciences of all time. This idea may not even be that far away scientist continue to research and invent every day and before we know it we will be living among A.I machines. This website I have created helps you the viewer understand what is to come in the world of A.I and also what is happening right now. If you wish to learn about A.I machines or just how Alexa and Siri fuctions this is the website for you.

      “I have always been convinced that the only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain. That is the goal I have been pursuing. We are making progress, though we still have lots to learn about how the brain actually works.” - Geoffrey Hinton, Famous AI Scientist. This quote by Geoffrey Hinton really sums up what A.I could become if someone finds away for it to be pushed to its fullest potential. This is something that scientist could be getting close to achieving. Although A.I so far has become a very useful tool, many people still have some skepticism about what A.I could become. Could A.I steal my job? Will A.I kill us all? These are frequent questions by many people, but so far A.I. has been a very helpful tool.
