      "AI is a computer system able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules." - Jeremy Achin

      A.I. is a part of the computer science's which focuses around creating an intelligent machine that can do many things such as control the lighting in your house, setting a date in a calendar and telling you the news. But these things are only scratching the surface of the capabilities of what A.I could become in the coming years. A.I has so much potential and the way we see A.I in a few years will be much different to the way we see it now because the world of A.I is always changing.

      A.I has been around for years the first real A.I program was made by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. This program was called Logic Theorist. This machine used automated reasoning to solve mathematic equations. Logic Theorist was ground breaking and began the race to create the most powerful A.I machine. 1956 to 1974 were referred to the golden years of A.I. Massive leaps were made in these years. Researchers in these years worked off what Newell and Simon's creation and made something more advanced. There were high hopes for the world of A.I.

      "AI has been an integral part of SAS software for years. Today we help customers in every industry capitalize on advancements in AI, and we’ll continue embedding AI technologies like machine learning and deep learning in solutions across the SAS portfolio." - Jim Goodnight

      “The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.”— Stephen Hawking, what Stephen Hawking is talking about has been a fear that people have had around A.I sinces its inception. There have been constant fears around A.I since the 1950s, fears such as A.I taking jobs and A.I becoming more powerful than humans. These fears of A.I have been portrayed in the movie franchise Terminator where intelligent robots go back in time and try to kill Sarah Connor. The Terminator uses the fears that people have had to create a blockbuster movie series. The reason there is so many fears about A.I is because still not much is known about the capabilities of A.I. There is still so much to discover in the world of A.I that it frightens a lot of people. But for now A.I science looks very promising and could help humans solve a lot of issues that happen in the world.
